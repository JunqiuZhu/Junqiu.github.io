I'm a postdoctoral fellow of University of California, Santa Babara advised by Prof. [Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/). I received my Ph.D. degree from Shandong University, China, in 2022, working under the supervision of [Prof. Xiangxu Meng](http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/info/1010/1073.htm), co-supervised by [Prof. Lu Wang](http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/info/1010/1060.htm), and [Prof. Yanning Xu](http://vr.sdu.edu.cn/info/1010/1062.htm). I was remotely supervised by [Prof. Lingqi Yan](https://sites.cs.ucsb.edu/~lingqi/) during my doctoral studies.

Research Interest
======
My research is in Computer Graphics and mainly focuses on visual appearance modeling and rendering. I work to understand why materials in the real world look the way they do and how we can accurately and effectively model their interaction with light.
